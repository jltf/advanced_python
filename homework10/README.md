# Homework 10

A tourist wants to make a good trip at the weekend with his friends.
They will go to the mountains to see the wonders of nature, so he
needs to pack well for the trip.

He has a good knapsack for carrying things, but knows that he can
carry a maximum of only 4kg in it, and it will have to last the
whole day. He creates a list of what he wants to bring for the trip
but the total weight of all items is too much. He then decides to add
columns to his initial list detailing their weights and a numerical
value representing how important the item is for the trip. The tourist
can choose to take any combination of items from the list, but only one
of each item is available. He may not cut or diminish the items, so he
can only take whole units of any item.
